# stock-predictor
The purpose of this project is to find a model which is able to profit from the market moves of some stock. For the scope of this project, we chose Apple Inc. stock (ticker: AAPL), although any model we use can be applied to any other stock financial data. Our aim is to make higher profits than some chosen benchmark with lower risk than the given benchmark. The dataset comes from Quandl, a marketplace for financial and economic data offering open-source data. We enclosed a copy of it in our GitHub repo.
