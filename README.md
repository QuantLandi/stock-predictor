# Brief description
The purpose of this project is to find a model which is able to profit from the
market moves of some stock. For the scope of this project, we chose Apple
Inc. stock (ticker: AAPL), although any model we use can be applied to any other
stock financial data. Our aim is to make higher profits than some chosen
benchmark with lower risk than the given benchmark.
